## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) - For data fetching

### What I learned

- 80% of the work takes 20% of the time. Building out the initial JSX/CSS took barely any time, but getting the animations right took way longer to make them feel natural.

### Continued development

- I'd like to get a better understanding of how to use `AnimatePresence` from Framer Motion. It seems incredibly tricky to use properly.
